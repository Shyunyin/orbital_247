Problem Motivation: 
1. In a world where we are constantly trying to boost our productivity, we can often forget to strike a good balance between work and rest.
2. We are either not being adequately productive or being too tired from overworking

	- To include categories (Work, Exercise, Miscellaneous)
	- Time/Duration option
	- Time/Duration scroll
	- Option for the number of sesisons 
	- Counter to see how many more work hours remain
	- ‘Go back to Schedule’ button
2. Today’s schedule page 
	- To include timetable
	- Small sticky note at the side with unscheduled tasks that were just added 
	- Generate schedule button at the bottom
	- Counter (for hours of tasks completed)
	- Progress bar
	- Button to remove and reschedule tasks
	- Actual date and time
	- Edit timing of fixed tasks
	- Logo & other aesthetics
3. Initial set-up 
	- Adding routine tasks and commitments (similar way to the adding tasks pop-up page)
4. Statistics 
	- To include percentage of the scheduled tasks that are completed each day (take the average over a week)
	- Number of hours spent doing your tasks
	- Number of hours spent under each category
	- Time period that you are most productive (can adjust future schedules according to this)

User stories: 
1. As a student who juggles school work and various other commitments, I want to be able to have an automatic scheduler so that I can have a guideline on what tasks to do at what time.

2. As an adult with a variety of tasks to complete, such as work, household chores and running errands, I require a structure to follow so that I can ensure that I regularly attend to all of my tasks.

3. As someone who tends to overestimate the amount of work I can complete in a day, I require an application that can help me gauge a realistic and feasible amount of work to do every day. 

4. As someone who struggles to keep track of my task progression throughout the day, I would like an application that helps to track my progress, alerts me when I am behind or ahead of schedule and measures my overall productivity for the day.
